** Class for encoding/decoding of text using base 64 coding.
**
** See RFC 2045 for details on base 64 coding.
** Code is based on the original GPLed work by Dawit Alemayehu and Rik Hemsley
** (KDE development team). Many changes have been made and some optimization
** should have been reached. Original version did not ignore padding-chars
** while decoding - see RFC 2045 ;)
