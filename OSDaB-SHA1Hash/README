detailed description
--------------------
A small class implementing the SHA1 hashing algorithm. 

SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a cryptographically safe function developed by NIST and NSA in 1992. It fulfills all the requirements imposed for one-way hashing functions and it generates very different images for similar sequences. This code is based on the 100% free public domain implementation by Dominik Reichl. 

NO WARRANTY is given for this code. Use it at your own risk. It should always compute correct SHA1 digests, but no security-related tests have been made.
