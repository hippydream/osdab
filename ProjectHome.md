# Some history #

The OSDaB Project was born in 2005 as a quite different project. The goal was to write a series of collection managers. **Movida**, a movie collection manager, is the first and only application written for the old version of the project.

The old OSDaB Project website contained a "Developer's Corner" section with code snippets and tips that came up during the development on Movida. The Developer's Corner has now taken full control of the website and project :)

Development on Movida is still going on as a stand-alone project: [movida.42cows.org](http://movida.42cows.org)
