detailed description
--------------------
A small class implementing the SHA1 hashing algorithm. 

SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a cryptographically safe function developed by NIST and NSA in 1992. It fulfills all the requirements imposed for one-way hashing functions and it generates very different images for similar sequences. This code is based on the 100% free public domain implementation by Dominik Reichl. 

NO WARRANTY is given for this code. Use it at your own risk. It should always compute correct SHA1 digests, but no security-related tests have been made.

history
-------
2006-06-09 - Minor changes (documentation and binary compatibility). 
2005-10-02 - Added some methods to hash byte arrays. 
2005-09-30 - First public release.

features
--------
Qt interface for quickly computing the SHA1 digest of some file or buffer. 
Endianness-aware (see the SHA1_LITTLE_ENDIAN #define in the header file) 

no known issues
---------------

requirements
------------
Qt version 4.0.x or later
