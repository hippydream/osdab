detailed description
--------------------
A small class implementing base 64 (RFC 2045) encoding and decoding. 

Code is based on the original GPLed work by Dawit Alemayehu and Rik Hemsley (KDE development team). Many changes have been made and the routines should be slightly faster now.

history
-------
2013-06-23 - Replace QString::from|toAscii() with QString::from|toLatin1()
2006-06-09 - Minor changes (documentation and binary compatibility)
2005-09-30 - First public release

features
--------
Qt interface for quickly base 64 encoding or decoding of byte arrays. 
Supports both QByteArray and QBitArray. 
Code should be endianness-aware (no known endianness-related known issues so far ;).

requirements
------------
Qt version 4.0.x or later

notes
-----
The "Test files" subdirectory contains a base64 encoded file (encoded.txt) - the 
original file is decoded.png
